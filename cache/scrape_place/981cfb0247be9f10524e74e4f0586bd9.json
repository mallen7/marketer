Since then,  I have worked closely with my rep, James Kuhn, in gaining more knowledge not only in foam application,  but also in general business practice,\nfrom his years of experience as a former business owner.   Everyone involved has been very helpful and informative.   James has went above and beyond answering questions and giving advice,  even on the weekends and his days off.  I may have saved a few hundred dollars buying elsewhere,  but the help and quality of product,  I've received here is worth way more than the little money I could've saved in the initial purchase.",

On-site training by James Kuhn was fantastic.  With years of experience running his own spray foam company, James was able to answer every question and show all the techniques needed to be successful.\nFrom start to finish top-notch knowledge and dedication to training us like we would be a crew of his own company.  We learned more in a 3-day period than we could have learned in 5 year of trial and error on our own. When I decided to invest in our own foam rig and company, I knew I wouldn't be spraying but needed one of my best current employees to be trained to do so.  I am 100% confident in the training we received, and I am sure this will be a very profitable investment for us.\n\nThank you Profoam- the best in the business!",
